## About

This repository contains a story about relative values. It is built on top of [this nextjs/squiggle integration template](). 

## Roadmap

- [x] Sketch how the output will look
- [x] Get a skeleton working
- [ ] Add a few estimates of value of consumption
- [ ] Add estimates of alternatives to consumption
  - [ ] Using a cool relative values graph
  - [ ] Using a relative values table
  - [ ] Find out whether my preferences are cyclic? My marginal 5k of consumption > Saving for the option value > Donating to charity > My marginal 5k of consumption?
- [ ] Relative values over career options.
  - [ ] Relative values in general.
  - [ ] Relative values taking into account personal fit.
- [ ] Conclusion, reflection, comparison with foretold.
- Misc issues:
  - [ ] Look into "isCallback". Slava says: "But don't forget about useCallback, lack of it can kill React.memo optimization."
  - [ ] Look into autoresizing textarea components (that are controllable) <https://github.com/Andarist/react-textarea-autosize>
- [ ] wrap mean(mixture(d)) into its own function, called something like numberOrDistributionIntoDistribution.
